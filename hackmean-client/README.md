# HackMEAN Client

This is the Angular client component of [HackMEAN application](./../). This app has been developed using the Angular version 7.9.

## Develop
Install the require dependencies by running `npm install` in this folder.

If you make changes to the client run the following script to deploy this client to the `/public` folder of HackMEAN:
```bash
npm run build
```

Once the client is deployed to `/public` folder it can be accessed by directly navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Though if you are developing it makes more sense to run `ng serve` in this folder for live reloading goodness. In that case you can access the client at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
